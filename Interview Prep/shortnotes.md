# Interview soft skill qs

1. Tell me about yourself (tmay)
   - This most well practiced answer
   - Pro tip: write this down. Have a written document of your tmay spiel

        - Ex: I graduated with a BS CS degree from UP Baguio.
        - Note you don't have to talk about your year of graduation, (esp if its recent)
        - If your degree is completely unrelated to the field, maybe not mention it

Furthermore, with the front end, I am adept in : HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap JS, as well the front end fw angular.

The most prominent being my P3 where I was chosen as the TL, and I was responsible for (list responsibilities here).

## Note: Throughout an interview you want to exude confidence and competence.

Now that you're moving on to the interview phase, keep in mind that delivery is important. You want to let your personality shine through in an interview. Even if you don't feel confident or if you feel nervous, fake it till you make it. You can trick people in thinking you're competent/confident by simply fixing your posture and body language.
